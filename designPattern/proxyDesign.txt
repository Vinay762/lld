Why Use a Proxy?


    Lazy Initialization (Virtual Proxy)
    Delay costly object creation until it’s actually needed—e.g. deferring loading of a large image, database connection or heavyweight data structure.

    Access Control & Security (Protection Proxy)
    Gatekeeper that checks permissions or roles before forwarding a request to the real object—e.g. only authorized users can call certain methods.

    Remote Access (Remote/Remote-Proxy)
    Provide a local “stub” for an object that lives on another server or process, handling the network communication under the hood.

    Performance Optimization (Caching Proxy)
    Cache expensive calls or computed results so repeat requests return immediately without re-computing or re-fetching.

    Logging, Auditing, or Instrumentation (Logging Proxy)
    Intercept calls to log parameters, measure timing, count usage, or emit metrics before and/or after delegating to the real object.
